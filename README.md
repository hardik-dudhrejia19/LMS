DalSoft5410 Management is a multi-cloud serverless application created using the services of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It focuses on communication between services to build a fast, robust, and scalable pipeline to cater to multiple organisations. 


We have created a user-interactive application using React.js and it is deployed on Heroku.

The React application's code-base has folders for each module and inside them, there is code for that respective module. The code for the cloud functions and lambda functions is kept in the serverless-services/components folder in the repository. In this, there are separate folders for each module and inside those folders, there is code for that respective module.

Here is the link of the deployed application:- https://serverless-group-14.herokuapp.com/login

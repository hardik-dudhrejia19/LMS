The DalSoft5410 Management is a mulit-cloud serverless application created using the services of Amazon Web Serivces (AWS) and Google Cloud platform (GCP). It focuses on communication between services to build fast, robust, and scalable pipeline to cater software to multiple organisations 


We have created a ReactJS appplication that is built using NodeJS. The application is deployed on Heroku.

The react application has folders for each module and inside it there is code for that respective module. The code for the cloud functions and lambda functions is kept in the serverless-services/components folder in the repository. In this there are separate folders for each module and inside those folders there is code for that respective module
